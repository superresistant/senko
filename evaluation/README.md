# Senko Evaluation via OpenBench
The following benchmarks on standard datasets were performed using [OpenBench](https://github.com/argmaxinc/OpenBench) by [Argmax](https://www.argmaxinc.com). Using OpenBench allows for standardized, reproducible evaluation and comparison with other diarization systems.

Default settings were used (which in OpenBench are `collar=0.0` and `skip_overlap=False`), meaning the results below for Senko can be compared with those of other diarization systems and services benchmarked by Argmax and compiled in [BENCHMARKS.md](https://github.com/argmaxinc/OpenBench/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md) in the OpenBench repo.

Some important notes:
- Definitions of `DER`, `SF`, `SCA` can be found in the OpenBench `BENCHMARKS.md`
- For a fair comparison of `Speed Factor (SF)` results, be sure to look at the hardware used to conduct the benchmarks in OpenBench's `BENCHMARKS.md` (listed under "Benchmarked Systems"), and compare that with the hardware used to evaluate Senko below.

See the instructions after the benchmarks below for reproducing these results.

## Evaluation Setup
Create a Python virtual environment and activate it
```
uv venv --python 3.11.13 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Install dependencies
```sh
# For NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA compute capability >= 7.5 (~GTX 16 series and newer)
uv pip install -r requirements.txt "git+https://github.com/narcotic-sh/senko.git[nvidia]"

# For NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA compute capability < 7.5 (~GTX 10 series and older)
uv pip install -r requirements.txt "git+https://github.com/narcotic-sh/senko.git[nvidia-old]"

# For Mac (macOS 14+) and CPU execution on all other platforms
uv pip install -r requirements.txt "git+https://github.com/narcotic-sh/senko.git"
```
Run the evaluation script
```sh
# Evaluate on specific dataset
python evaluate.py --dataset voxconverse

# Evaluate on all datasets
python evaluate.py --all-datasets

# [--device, --vad, --clustering, --num-samples] options also available; see evaluate.py
```
Note: Datasets will be automatically downloaded from Hugging Face. If you run into rate limiting, it helps to add your Hugging Face token as an environment variable `export HF_TOKEN="..."`.
