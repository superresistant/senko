# Senko Development Setup Guide
## Pre-requisites
- `gcc/clang` if on Linux or WSL
- `git`
    - On macOS, comes with the Xcode Command Line Tools
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation)

## Development Setup Steps
First create and activate a Python virtual environment
```
uv venv --python 3.11.13 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Clone the Senko repository
```
git clone https://github.com/narcotic-sh/senko.git
```
Then install using editable mode (`-e`)
```bash
# For NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA compute capability >= 7.5 (~GTX 16 series and newer)
uv pip install -e "/path/to/cloned/senko[nvidia]"

# For NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA compute capability < 7.5 (~GTX 10 series and older)
uv pip install -e "/path/to/cloned/senko[nvidia-old]"

# For Mac (macOS 14+) and CPU execution on all other platforms
uv pip install -e "/path/to/cloned/senko"
```
For NVIDIA, make sure the installed driver is CUDA 12 capable (should see `CUDA Version: 12+` in `nvidia-smi`)

Now you can modify the Senko code in the cloned repository folder. Changes will be reflected immediately if only the Python code was changed; if the C++ code was changed, you'll have to run the `uv pip install -e` command to rebuild the C++ code before changes are reflected.

Then use Senko like normal in scripts:
```python
from senko import Diarizer
import json

diarizer = Diarizer(device='auto', warmup=True, quiet=False)
result = diarizer.diarize('audio.wav', generate_colors=False) # 16kHz mono 16-bit wav

with open('./audio_diarized.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(result["merged_segments"], f, indent=2)
```
Also see `examples/diarize.py`.
